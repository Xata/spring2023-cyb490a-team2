# Scavenger Hunt

During the scavenger hunt, the team was provided with a set of instructuctions to follow in order to find the required items

Items to find:

- Firewall rules
  The firewall rules are placed under policies -> then security
  - under said policies, a question that arised was 'what is one thing you would change in regard to access that users have to the internet?'
    Under the firewall rules, the users are able to access http_proxy sites, and there is no rule stating that when a user wants to access a non-secure site that a warning should be displayed. That is one thing I would change, display a warning upon attempting to access an http_proxy site.
- Rule specifics
  The log parameter for the sessions is set to log at the end. These sessions can be found under 'activity logs' or 'dashboard'
- Offenses in System
  Offenses triggered in the system were:

  - Account failed to log on
  - Domain controller failed to validate the credentials for an account
  - An account failed to log on

- Purpose of QRadaris to log and trigger alerts or intrusions in a system, it also establishes and defines rules

## Qradar

Qradar is a Security Information and Event Mangement (SIEM) system. SIEM systems are used for a number of functions, the four most common being log collection, event correlation, alert generation, and incident response. These functions serve to facilitate proactive monitoring and protecting of an organization's network and systems from security threats.

In the scavenger hunt, we were tasked with going to a specific IP address and tracking it in the log. Due to how the network was setup, we were not able to find the traffic in the SIEM's log because it was not connected to that host.
