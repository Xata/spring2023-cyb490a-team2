# Scavenger Hunt

During the scavenger hunt, the team was provided with a set of
 instrtuctions to follow in order to find the required items

Items to find:

* Firewall rules
The firewall rules are placed under policies  -> then security
  * under said policies, a question that arised was 'what is one thing you would change in regard to access that users have to the internet?'
Under the firewall rules, the users are able to access http_proxy sites, and there is no rule stating that when a user wants to access a non-secure site that a warning should be displayed. That is one thing I would change, display a warning upon attempting to access an http_proxy site.
* Rule specifics
The log parameter for the sessions is set to log at the end. These sessions can be found under 'activity logs' or 'dashboard'
* Offenses in System
Offenses triggered in the system were:
  * Account failed to log on
  * Domain controller failed to validate the credentials for an account
  * An account failed to log on

* Purpose of QRadaris to log and trigger alerts or intrusions in a system, it also establishes and defines rules
