## Introduction
This repository contains all the necessary files and documents for homework projects assigned during the course. This centralized repository provides a convenient and organized way for members of Team 2 to collaborate on homework. The repository is also a way for Team 2 to submit their homework. This repository contains various types of files, including documentation, reports, presentations, sample code, and screenshots that are relevant to the coursework. By using GitHub, allows Team 2 to demonstrate GitHub and collaboration skills as well as demonstrate projects done during the course.
### About the Course
Cybersecurity Operations (CYB490A) provides students with hands-on experience in protecting organizations from cybersecurity incidents. During the course members of Team 2 learn about tools, techniques, and methods for defending against various cyber threats. The course has a focus on incident response, threat analysis, and vulnerability management. Students get to apply their knowledge during the use of a simulated environment. The simulation is designed to replicate a real-world organization and allows for students to learn about real-world cybersecurity incidents.

## Virtualization, Emulation, and Containerization
## Range Scavenger Hunt
During the Scavenger Hunt on the Cybersecurity Range, we familiarized ourselves with the range, tools, and technologies that we'll be using throughout the Spring semester. The Scavenger Hunt was designed for us to explore the environment within the range. We were given a list of tasks to complete to learn more about the tools in Cybersecurity.

## Scenario 1
In this simulation on the Cybersecurity Range, we were tasked with reviewing data to discover an event, then evaluate that event to discern whether an investigation was needed. Once enough evidence was found to confirm the occurence of an incident, we opened an investigation and gathered more data to understand where the breach was and what its purpose was. After the investigation was completed and we had identified relevant data, we were able to contain, eradicate, and remediate the event. Finally we concluded with reflecting on actionable lessons learned to prepare for the next possible incident.
